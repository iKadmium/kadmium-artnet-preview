# kadmium-artnet-preview

This is a preview visualisation tool for DMX universes. It's a companion-tool for the [Kadmium DMX](https://github.com/iKadmium/kadmium-osc-dmx-dotnet) project, but may be expanded at a later stage for more general use. It's currently in an early stage and not ready for public use.

# Requirements

This tool was created in the Unity engine and you'll need the Unity editor to build it.
